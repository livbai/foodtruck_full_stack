Food Trucks Search Project

developer: Le Gao (backend)  https://www.linkedin.com/pub/le-gao/21/b71/199

1. Develop environment: play framwork; java (backend); H2 in memory db; leafletjs + css (front end)

2. WS API called: 
   2.1 http://data.sfgov.org/resource/rqzj-sfat.json (food truck info)
   2.2 https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json  (geocoding API from google)

3. Functionality:
   3.1 Search food truck info in San Francisco area and display the results on a openstreetmap;
   3.2 Search parameters:
       3.2.1 Zip code: a zip in SF area. if the zip input is not in SF area, will show “the zip provided is not in SF”;
       3.2.2 Food type: keyword of the food items, default is “any”;
       3.2.3 Distance(miles): from the center of the zip, filter the results based on the distance;
       
4. Potential future improvement:
   4.1 Automatically zoom into the location of the map when clicking one of the food trucks in the list.
   4.2 Validation for user's input.
   4.3 Other than zip, user can provide an address to find the food truck. Additional fuzzy address recognition may be needed.
   4.4 User geolocalize technique may be a big plus.
   4.4 User comments for each food truck may be a good idea 
   4.5 Currently we use in memory db, if we change to regular db like mysql, additional in memory cache may be needed to save the hot search
   4.6 Need to make display auto fit for different browser, different OS and on mobile device
